# HedgehogCore

HedgehogCore is an SFML-based game "engine" (sort of) meant to accurately replicate the gameplay of the 90s-era Sonic the Hedgehog games.

(The engine is not yet in a usable state.)
The features currently implemented include:
- Near-complete Sonic gameplay
- Accurate tile-based collision
- Parallax backgrounds  

Features currently in development
- Sprite-based objects with Unity-esque component-based behaviour
- The accompanying editor HedgehogEditor
- Saving & loading of rooms

Planned features include
- Rings
- UI elements
- Tails & Knuckles' gameplay
- Collision with sprite-based objects
- Tilemap editing

And yeah, the codebase is a bit of a mess.
The engine is a personal project. It's not meant to be professional, and the code quality often reflects that.
It also doesn't help that I wrote a big part of it when I was still learning C++.

Alright, that's about it.
